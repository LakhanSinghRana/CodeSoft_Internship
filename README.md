# CodeSoft_Internship
This is the repository of my internship at CodSoft. I uploaded all the projects that I programmed under this internship.

During my internship journey I have learnt so many things and improved my python programming skills through these amazing projects - 
 1. To Do List
 2. Calculator
 3. Password Generator
 4. Quiz Game

I have uploaded all the files related to these tasks in my repository. Please feel free to open them an check them out.
I took help various platforms that gave me thourough understanding of the program and how to code them more efficiently.

To run these codes please follow the instructions - 
    1. Please copy them locally into your local machine.
    2. Then if you have python downloaded in your computer - > you are good to go.
    3. But if you don't have python then please download it first then copy them into your pc. Moreover, you can run them directly online after copying.

Thankyou for reading this readme.md file.
